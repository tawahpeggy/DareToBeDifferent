<h3>
    Abstraction
</h3>
<p>
    Abstraction is one of the four fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. <br>
 It refers to the practice of hiding the complexity of the underlying implementation and exposing only the essential features of the object. <br>
 This allows the user to interact with the object in a simple and intuitive way without needing to know how it works internally.
</p>

Here's an example code snippet in C++ that demonstrates abstraction:
<pre class="code-block">
    <code>
        
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Abstract class
class Shape {{"{"}}
   public:
      virtual void draw() = 0; // pure virtual function
{{"}"}};

// Concrete class
class Rectangle : public Shape {{"{"}}
   public:
      void draw() {{"{"}}
         cout << "Drawing a rectangle." << endl;
      {{"}"}}
{{"}"}};
// Concrete class
class Circle : public Shape {{"{"}}
   public:
      void draw() {{"{"}}
         cout << "Drawing a circle." << endl;
      {{"}"}}
{{"}"}};

// Main function
int main() {{"{"}}
   Shape* s1 = new Rectangle(); // Instantiate a rectangle object
   s1->draw(); // Call the draw function on the rectangle object

   Shape* s2 = new Circle(); // Instantiate a circle object
   s2->draw(); // Call the draw function on the circle object

   return 0;
{{"}"}}
    </code>
</pre>
 
<p>
    In this example, we have an abstract class called  Shape  that contains a pure virtual function  draw(). 
</p>
<p> This means that any class that inherits from  Shape  must implement the  draw()  function. </p>
<p>
    We then have two concrete classes,  Rectangle  and  Circle , that inherit from  Shape  and provide their own implementation of the  draw()  function.

</p>

<p>
    Finally, in the main function, we create objects of type  Rectangle  and  Circle  and call their  draw()  functions using a pointer of type  Shape*.

</p>
<p>
    This allows us to interact with the objects in a simple and intuitive way without needing to know the underlying implementation details.

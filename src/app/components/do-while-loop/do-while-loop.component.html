    DO-WHILE LOOPS
</h3>
do-while loops are post-test loops: the loop condition is tested after the loop body is executed. That means the body of the do-while loop will always execute, at least once.
Syntax:
do "{{ '{' }}"
// loop body executes as long as condition is true
"{{ '}' }}" while (condition)

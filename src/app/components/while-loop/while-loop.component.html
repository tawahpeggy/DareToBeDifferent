<h3>WHILE LOOPS
</h3>
A While loop is similar to a For loop but a While loop runs a variable number of times and uses a CONDITIONAL. Let's consider the example given above and see where conditionals come in. Given that your tv is on for an hour but it doesn't show the channel you want. A possible algorithm for this is;
⦁	Put tv on
⦁	Show channel
⦁	Check if channel is appopriate.
⦁	(Conditional) if channel is not appopriate, change channel until it finds it, then displays it.
 While loops are pre-test loops: the loop condition is tested before the loop body is executed. 
Syntax:
while (condition) "{{ '{' }}"
// condition is any boolean expression
// loop body executes as long as condition is true
"{{ '}' }}"

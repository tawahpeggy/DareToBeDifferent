<h3>
    Inheritance

</h3>
<p>
    Inheritance is a feature in C++ that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class. The class that is being inherited from in called the base class,
 while the class that is inheriting from the base class is called the derived class 
</p>

To create a derived class in C++ use the syntax below:

<pre class="code-block">
    <code>
        class DerivedClass: accessSpecifier
BaseClass {{"{"}}
  //class members and methods
{{"}"}}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    The access specifier can be either  public ,  protected , or  private  and determines how the derived class can access the members of the base class.

</p>
<p>
    In public inheritance, the public members of the base class become public members of the derived class,
 the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class,
 and the private members of the base class are not accessible by the derived class.
</p>

<p>
    In Protected inheritance, the public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class,
 and the private members of the base class are not accessible by the derived class.
</p>

<p>
    In Private Inheritance, the protected and public members of the class become private members of the derived class,
 and the protected members of the base class are not accessible by the derived class.
</p>

In C++, there are three types of inheritance:

<p>
    1. Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits the properties of only one base class.
 The derived class inherits the data members and member functions of the base class.
</p>

2. Multiple inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit the properties of more than one base class.
 This means that the derived class has multiple base classes and it can access the data members and member functions of all of them.

3. Multilevel inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.
 This means that the base class for the derived class is itself a derived class. In this type of inheritance, the properties of the first derived class are inherited by the second derived class, and so on.

<pre class="code-block">
    <code>
        // Base class
class Animal {{"{"}}
public:
    void eat() {{"{"}}
        cout << "Animal is eating." << endl;
    {{"}"}}
{{"}"}};

// Derived class
class Dog : 
public Animal {{"{"}}

public:
    void bark() {{"{"}}
        cout << "Dog is barking." << endl;
    {{"}"}}
{{"}"}};

int main() {{"{"}}
    // Create an object of Dog class
    Dog myDog;

    // Call methods of the derived class
    myDog.bark();

    // Call methods of the base class
    myDog.eat();

    return 0;
{{"}"}}
    </code>
</pre>
 

<p>
    In this example, the  Dog  class is derived from the  Animal  class using the  public  access modifier.
This means that all public members of the  Animal  class are accessible from the  Dog  class.
The  Dog  class adds a new public method  bark()  in addition to the  eat()  method inherited from the  Animal  class. 
</p>

In the  main()  function, an object of the  Dog  class is created and the  bark()  and  eat()  methods are called on it. The  bark()  method is a method of the  Dog  class, while the  eat()  method is inherited from the Animal class.

<!-- Classes 

A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.
It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.

class Person {
  private:
    std::string name;
    int age;
  
  public:
    Person(std::string n, int a) {
      name = n;
      age = a;
    }
  
    void say_hello() {
      std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
    }
  
    void set_age(int a) {
      age = a;
    }
};
 

This class is called "Person" and it has two private data members,
 a string for the person's name and an integer for their age. 
The class has two public member functions: a constructor that takes a name and
 age as arguments and sets the corresponding data members,
 and a member function called "say\_hello" that prints out a message introducing the person. 
The class also has a public member function called "set\_age" that allows the age to be changed.

Here's an example of how you could use this class:

Person alice("Alice", 25);
alice.say_hello(); // prints "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
alice.set_age(30);
alice.say_hello(); // prints "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old." -->
